					Have a quick look at a few important tables.
					To check deployment: select * from ACT_RE_DEPLOYMENT
					To check running process: select * from ACT_RE_PROCDEF
					To check running task: select * from ACT_RU_TASK
					Select * from  ACT_HI_TASKINST             **********
					SELECT * FROM ACT_GE_BYTEARRAY 
					SELECT * FROM ACT_HI_ACTINST               ********  ACT_TYPE_/userTask/startEvent/	userTask/	userTask
					
					SELECT * FROM ACT_HI_DETAIL 
					
				Go to Tasklist and click on the claim and complete the task. Refresh the Cockpit and you can see the running process is completed.

				Further, check out the below tables to see the history of the executed process and task where all the running tasks and processes are completed and having updated END_TIME_.
					To check the completed process: SELECT * FROM ACT_HI_PROCINST
					To check the completed task: select * from ACT_HI_TASKINST
